                The children are cared for in groups according to age. However, this margin is flexible to ensure that no child is held back
                or moved up into another group until they are completely ready.</p>

                You are encouraged to let staff know details of your child’s routine, special dietary requirements, likes and dislikes and
                anything else that you may think is important. We will ask you to complete a 'base line' upon starting which is like a 'tick chart' and this will give us an indication of where you feel your child is developmentally.&nbsp; We will then take this information, keeping in mind what your child already knows, so that the activities are challenging, yet fun.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;There will always be a member of the team available to tell
                you about your child’s day.</span></p>

                All children are treated as individuals and encouraged to develop at their own pace. We also follow strict guidelines on
                equality, and celebrate the cultural diversity of our children. We adopt the same approach when dealing with
                parents/carers,’ religious and personal beliefs.

                Discipline is approached in a positive manner. We reward and encourage children to behave in an acceptable way and to care
                and respect each other. We also have a 'no shouting' policy throughout the nursery.</p>
